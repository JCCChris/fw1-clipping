<H2>&lt;CF_QueryMergeSideBySide&gt;</H2>

See also CF_QueryUnion.
This tag takes two query result sets and creates a new query that contains
data from both queries.  The new query has all the columns from the first query,
plus all the columns from the second query.  Whatever was in row one of each
query will be in the first row of the new query, and so on.  Please note that this tag makes no attempt to "sync up" or "join" the rows
intelligenty.  It just copies data.  It is your responsibility to ensure that the first row of the first query
corresponds with the first row of the second query.

<P>The new query will have the same number of rows as the first query.  This means that if the first query has
more rows than the second, the "extra" rows will be unpopulated (blank) in the new query.
If, on the other hand, the second query has more rows than the first, the "extra" rows
will be ignored.  Columns with the same name in both queries are assumed to hold data in common and are
included in the new query only once.




<P><B>Parameters</B><BR>

<TABLE BORDER>
  <TR VALIGN="TOP"><TD>QUERY1</TD>
    <TD>
		  Required.  The first query.  All the columns and rows from this query will appear in the new query.
		</TD>
	</TR>

  <TR VALIGN="TOP"><TD>QUERY2</TD>
    <TD>
		  Required.  The second query.  The columns from this query will appear in the new
			query, to the right of the columns from the first query.  A column name that already
			appears in the new query because a column with that name was in QUERY1 will not be included.
		</TD>
	</TR>

  <TR VALIGN="TOP"><TD>NAME</TD>
    <TD>
		  Required.  A name for the new query.  This name can then be used as the QUERY parameter
			of a CFOUTPUT tag, etc.
		</TD>
	</TR>

<P><B>Example</B><BR>

The following example runs two queries, then merges them together side-by-side.
The CFX_SHOWQUERY tag is then used to demonstrate the "before and after", but it's certainly
not required.  The actual example is pretty pointless (why not just SELECT * in the first query
and be done with it?), but it demonstrates what the tag does.

<XMP>
<CFQUERY NAME="SomeQuery" DATASOURCE="A2Z">
  SELECT CustomerID, Company
  FROM Customers
</CFQUERY>

<CFQUERY NAME="SomeOtherQuery" DATASOURCE="A2Z">
  SELECT CustomerID, FirstName, LastName
  FROM Customers
</CFQUERY>

<CF_QueryMergeSideBySide
  QUERY1="SomeQuery"
  QUERY2="SomeOtherQuery"
  NAME="MyNewQuery">

<CFX_ShowQuery Query="Q1">
<CFX_ShowQuery Query="Q2">
<CFX_ShowQuery Query="MyNewQuery">
</XMP>

<P>The above code might produce something like the following output:<BR>
