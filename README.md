ColdFusion + FW/1 App to store news articles
---------------------------------------------------

I created this app as an exercise to learn the [FW/1 Framework](https://github.com/framework-one/fw1).

Here's some of the topics I tried to cover:

### Project Structure

### Forms and Validation

### Use of UDF Libraries

### Use of static assets

### Accessing an External Service

### BDD Testing
