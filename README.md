ColdFusion + FW/1 App to store news articles
---------------------------------------------------

I created this app as an exercise to learn the [FW/1 Framework](https://github.com/framework-one/fw1).

Here's some of the topics I tried to cover:

#### Project Structure
I decided to use subsystems, so the main app's logic is inside the **/home** folder (which is the default subsystem).
Notice that I added these folders to the project's root:

**/lib** - Stores User Defined Functions and UDF libraries

**/setup** - Contains the SQL script for database creation

**/static** - This is where I keep JS, CSS and images

**/tests** - Self explanatory

#### Forms and Validation

#### Use of UDF Libraries

#### Use of static assets

#### Accessing an External Service

#### BDD Testing
